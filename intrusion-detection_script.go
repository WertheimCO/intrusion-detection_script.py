package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// Define the IP address and port to listen on
	ip := "0.0.0.0"
	port := 8080

	// Set up the socket and start listening for incoming traffic
	addr := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", ip, port)
	listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", addr)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error listening on %s: %v", addr, err)
	}
	defer listener.Close()

	// Continuously read incoming packets and analyze them for intrusion attempts
	for {
		conn, err := listener.Accept()
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error accepting connection: %v", err)
			continue
		}

		// Read data from the connection
		buf := make([]byte, 1024)
		n, err := conn.Read(buf)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error reading data from connection: %v", err)
			continue
		}

		// Detect intrusion attempts
		data := string(buf[:n])
		if strings.Contains(data, "DROP TABLE") {
			fmt.Println("SQL injection attempt detected!")
		} else if strings.Contains(data, "/admin") {
			fmt.Println("Attempt to access admin page detected!")
		}

		// Close the connection
		conn.Close()
	}
}

//In this example, we define the IP address and port to listen on and set up a socket to listen for incoming traffic. We then read data from incoming connections and analyze the data for intrusion attempts using string matching. If an intrusion attempt is detected, the script prints a message to the console. Finally, we close the connection and continue listening for incoming traffic.

Note that this is a simple example and a complete intrusion detection system would need to be more sophisticated and robust. However, this should give you a general idea of how to get started with intrusion detection in Go.
