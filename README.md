Intrusion detection script in Python

In this example, we set up a socket to listen for incoming traffic on port 8080. When a connection is established, we read incoming packets and analyze them for intrusion attempts using the detect_intrusion function. The function checks for common attack patterns such as SQL injection attempts and attempts to access the admin page of a web server. If an intrusion attempt is detected, the script prints a message to the console. Finally, we close the connection and continue listening for incoming traffic.

Note that this is a simple example and a complete intrusion detection system would need to be more sophisticated and robust, but this should give you a general idea of how to get started with intrusion detection in Python.
